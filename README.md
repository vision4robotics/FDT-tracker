# About Code
## 1. Environment setup
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.8.3, Pytorch 0.7.0/1.6.0, CUDA 10.2. Please install related libraries before running this code:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## 2. Test
Download pretrained model: [FDTmodel](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fTM66ZzcCQjPGg1_2-bDiA)(code:r0fy) and put it into `tools/snapshot` directory.

Download testing datasets and put them into `test_dataset` directory. If you want to test the tracker on a new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit.git) to set test_dataset.

       python test.py 
	        --dataset UAV10fps                 #dataset_name
	        --snapshot snapshot/FDTmodel.pth  # tracker_name
	
The testing result will be saved in the `results/dataset_name/tracker_name` directory.
## 3. Train
### Prepare training datasets

Download the datasets

### Train a model

To train the FDT model, run `train.py` with the desired configs:

`cd tools
python train.py`

## 4. Evaluation
We provide the tracking [results](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PoKNWFKJ40Loeu_E1GJuPQ)(code: 35rw) of UAV123@10fps, DTB70, UAVTrack112_L, and UAV123. If you want to evaluate the tracker, please put those results into `results` directory.

        python eval.py 	                          \
	         --tracker_path ./results          \ # result path
	         --dataset UAV123                  \ # dataset_name
	         --tracker_prefix 'FDTmodel'   # tracker_name
